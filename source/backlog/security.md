# Security considerations

```{hint}
At the moment there has been no decision if a person will have one European Campus Card per primary role and institution or if multiple roles can be merged into one card instance.
```

* A European Campus Card should not be copyable or transferable between devices.
* A card must be a singleton active instance (A shared instance for one phone + watch should be allowed)
